My wife and I took a vacation to Spain back in December, and I had done Duolingo for a couple of months leading up to it to brush up on my rusty Spanish skills. It was fun trying to talk with the people we met there, and it inspired me to want to improve.

"Get good" might be too strong a term for what I'm shooting for, but I like to be optimistic. I would love to, in the next couple of years, take another trip to a Spanish speaking country and be able to confidently speak to and understand native speakers while there. This is what many call "conversationally fluent", not to be confused with full fluency, and I think that's a very doable goal. Becoming ok with the idea that I won't sound excellent and will make many mistakes will allow me to get to that point much faster.

I also hope to get to where I can listen to podcasts where native speakers at normal speeds (i.e. not podcasts made for language learning) and watch Spanish language TV without subtitles. I think getting to that point would make it easy to maintain my skills, since it just involves consuming fun entertainment.

This article will be an overview of my plans and strategies for improving at Spanish this year, and then I'll post a follow-up article in two weeks about my word list I'm practicing, as well as the verb conjugation practice Excel sheet I made (which uses VBA of course). Both will be available for download there. Ok let's jump in!

## My Background
I'm a beginner, but am definitely not starting from zero. I took AP Spanish in high school, but failed the AP exam. In particular, listening skills were my major weakness. When I would lose track of the translation while someone was speaking, I'd usually never pick it back up. Because of that, I knew that listening was one of the main things I would need to work on.

During this time in high school, I actually went on trips to Peru and to Costa Rica, but my listening skills were so poor that I was totally unable to communicate and improve. I also didn't push onwards and keep trying to talk to people despite any embarrassment from not understanding, which is something I like to think I would do now.

I took a couple of Spanish classes in college as well, but I must have done poorly on the placement exam, because these classes felt completely remedial. I didn't think much about getting any better at Spanish since then, and over the next 9 or so years, I let my Spanish skills atrophy a good bit. So I have a long way to go, but have some basic vocabulary and understanding of sentence structure to build off of.

## The Inspiration
I did 2-3 months of Duolingo for maybe about 20 minutes per day before going on our vacation, as mentioned earlier. This consisted of brushing up on basic phrases and vocabulary that I already knew, but wouldn't have been able to recall without this preparation. 

While in Spain, I had only basic conversations with natives, but made sure to make myself say at least one thing in Spanish to every waiter and Uber driver, and this turned out to be a lot of fun and made me want to able to converse a lot better. I had plenty of support from my wife Julie, who studied abroad in Mexico in college and speaks and understands Spanish better than me. Here's one more picture from the Spain trip.

I had also read and heard some stuff, primarily from Tim Ferriss, in the last year or two about how learning a language doesn't have to take forever and be a lifelong pursuit if you're just aiming for conversational fluency. Most adults really overblow the process and say things about age being an obstacle. When, in reality, a dedicated adult can leverage a lot of strategy and focus and get to conversational fluency extremely quickly. We will see if this pans out for me, but I found it motivating.

All of this made me to want to improve and add Spanish learning to the mix of my goals and activities... of which I probably have too many :), not to mention a young daughter and a second kid on the way. So I knew any plans and aspirations should be kept to a reasonable scale that I can just get done whenever I feel like it, and hopefully still see slow and steady progress throughout the year.

Now for a more specific source of inspiration: during our Spain vacation, I stumbled on [this YouTube video][lang_lords] by a guy with the name Language Lords. In the same vein as the Tim Ferriss inspiration I mentioned, this guy studied Spanish for more than 40 hours a week, and claims to have reached conversational fluency in 44 days (but was NOT starting from zero Spanish knowledge). 

Obviously, I just mentioned that I have much, much less time per day to devote to the endeavor than he did, but nevertheless I found this video extremely inspiring, and I wanted to implement a few of his strategies.

I really loved one of his ideas, which is to watch a few Spanish language Ted Talks over and over until you understand every word, using transcripts as needed. I've watched a couple multiple times with the intent to do this, but haven't found the motivation to get into a routine with it, so I didn't include it in my list of strategies. But anyways, armed with this inspiration and motivation, I have been implementing the following strategies.

## The Strategies
**Duolingo 15-20 minutes every day** - This probably isn't the absolute best learning resource out of the ones we will discuss (I see it get criticism sometimes online), but I love how it gamifies practice and measures your progress. I got sucked in enough that I want to get all of the achievements in the app, which would include keeping up a "streak" of 365 days of using the app. I might write a little article on the strategies I used or am using to get all these achievements. It helps me solidify phrases and vocabulary, making sure I get enough repetition on new words and concepts.

**Rote practice of verb conjugations** - I'll talk a lot more about this in the follow-up article. This was inspired by Language Lords and how he decided verb conjugation would be worth just practicing directly. I agreed, but took it a bit further and made an Excel sheet with VBA which made practicing it a little easier and more fun. I'll have it ready and available to download in the follow-up article. I'll also talk about how I decided to use it, as well as what tenses I plan to learn and when.

**Common vocabulary words with Anki** - Again, more on this in the next article, but [Anki][anki] is like a flashcard software. I decided I wanted a little bit of rote vocabulary practice to acquire a decent vocabulary base a more quickly than I would organically through consuming content. I'll have this word list ready to download in the next article in case anyone else wants to practice them too!

**5 minute video recordings** - I think this is the most important activity on the list. This was also taken from Language Lords' video. Once every two weeks, I record a 5 minute video of me telling a story or talking on a subject, which I then send to my friend Ryan. If I want to take 2 or 3 attempts on the video, looking up some words or phrases in between, that is allowed. 

Ryan is not a native speaker, but has lived in Mexico for 11 years and majored in Spanish, so he's an excellent resource that I'm lucky to have access to. He gives me feedback on mistakes and progress and recommendations on where to improve. Hopefully at some point after I improve some more, we'll be having live conversations in Spanish.

I think this is the most crucial activity on this list because it provides accountability. I know I'll be recording a video and hope to show some improvement from the last one, so that motivates me to work more on the other activities. Also, it's just really hard to talk for 5 minutes straight, and any vocabulary I acquire in the process is probably relevant to my life. 

**Listening to podcasts** - There are a lot of good beginner and intermediate Spanish podcasts out there. I try to listen to "News in Slow Spanish", both the Spain and Latin American version each week, which are ten minute or less summaries of current news. And I also try to listen to one episode of "Palabras Bravas" each week, which is a bit less dry. The two hosts talk about an ongoing story and then teach you new phrases from it. It runs about 20 minutes per episode. 

This is not a large time commitment, as all of these are short, but it insures consistency on a minimum amount of listening practice, and I can already tell my listening skills have improved dramatically.

**Netflix repeats** - My strategy here is a little more fun. I have been watching Spanish language TV series on Netflix. In order to get legitimate practice from it, I watch an episode with Spanish audio and English subtitles, and then before moving onto the next episode, I rewatch it with Spanish audio and Spanish subtitles. 

This has been enjoyable and helps improve both my vocabulary and listening skills. I hope I eventually get good enough that I can do the first viewing with Spanish subtitles and the second one without any subtitles. Of course, being able to watch Spanish language TV with no subtitles at all is the dream. So far, I have watched the first seasons of two shows. Control Zeta is a high school drama with a crime investigation mixed in, and El Vecino is a comedy about an irresponsible 30-something year old man who gets super powers. Both have been great and I would recommend them! 

## Conclusion
I've been having a lot of fun working on these various approaches so far, and I can definitely already see some progress. I want to say a thank you to Ryan for reviewing my awkward speaking videos and sending feedback. Does anyone else have any language learning aspirations or experience? If so, let me know! And if there are any other approaches that any readers swear by, send them my way!
