We all want to live the best life we can achieve. What is the purpose of making or saving money other than to move us closer to that goal? Bill Perkins has some interesting thoughts and advice on how to use our money to best pursue an unforgettable life, and Die With Zero quickly became one of my favorite nonfiction books of all time.

Bill Perkins is an extremely wealthy, brash, high-stakes poker playing hedge fund manager. I'm a relatively frugal engineer who likes the idea of financial independence, so I didn't expect to get much out of this book. Thankfully I was wrong, and it has greatly influenced my lifestyle design thinking.

For anyone who wants a quick overview before reading on, I would say my top three takeaways are:
* Invest in remarkable experiences. They continue to pay you in the future through reminiscing, and are a large part of how you'll experience your older years.
* Think about what experiences you want to have at different ages and pursue them. Your health and the age of your children or parents aren't the same forever.
* Give the money you want to give to children and to charity long before you die, rather than letting the time and amount be determined for you randomly.

In the rest of article, we'll examine these concepts, along with a few others, in greater detail, and I'll also go over some of things from the book that I didn't end up agreeing with.

One last note before diving in. This book is intended for people with some disposable income, or who could free some up. People living in poverty might already be doing all they can to maximize their life experiences. But if you have some power or choice on how your money gets spent, this book has some food for thought.

## Why Die with Zero?
In the book The Psychology of Money, a man named Ronald Read is discussed early on. Ronald Read worked as a gas station attendant and mechanic for 25 years, and then as a part-time janitor at JC Penney for 17 years. He made history when he died in 2014, and left about 6 million dollars to a library and hospital.

This is extremely impressive, and his skills in saving and consistent investing are commendable. But I can't help but thinking, I sure hope he loved that job at JC Penney. I can't imagine he wouldn't have been able to find a more interesting way to thrive and have amazing experiences once money was taken care of. 

In a similar vein, in my articles on financial independence (FI) and coastFI, I discuss the fact that many people pursuing FI get so focused on saving money that they forget to enjoy life, and then end up regretting it later. I've read about more than one of them amassing double the amount of money they needed to be financially independent before working up the courage to leave a job they didn't like, only to find afterwards that they make more money than they expected doing something they love. 

To me this paints a clear picture. Managing your money well in order to improve your life is an extremely powerful tool. We just can't focus on the money so much that we forget about life. Die With Zero really hammers this point home and encourages us to be sure and save enough money so that our lives will be stable and our retirements comfortable, but then to not be afraid of spending the rest on living the best life you can.

## Big Ideas

### 1. Invest in Experiences
![backpack](/testpreviewsite/assets/backpacking.jpg)

Probably the biggest idea I took away from this book is the concept of thinking of your life experiences as part of your investment portfolio. Perkins portrays experiences as assets that pay a "memory dividend" over time. Not only do you enjoy an amazing backpacking trip through Europe when you take it, but every time you think about it or talk with friends about it afterwards, you experience a bit more joy from it. 

In this framework, remarkable experiences are appreciating assets that compound over time, whereas material purchases depreciate quickly. Not only does a new car lose monetary value quickly as you use it, but you get more and more used to the car and your enjoyment of it decreases over time. This relatively quick acclimation to new material luxuries is called hedonic adaptation. 

Additionally, Perkins brings up the idea of "life experience points", claiming that a major goal in life should be to maximize the total experience points you earn over its course. Saving zero money for retirement will result in so few experience points in old age that is far from optimal. Similarly waiting to enjoy your life till retirement will leave you too little time to rack up a large total.

Another conclusion resulting from this line of thinking is that you should invest in experiences early and often. Much like financial investing, time is a huge component in total portfolio growth. So the earlier you have those amazing experiences, the longer you will have to reminisce and enjoy them throughout your life, maximizing the earnings from your memory dividend.

This definitely interferes a bit with the power of investing your money early and giving it time to compound in the market, but Perkins makes the argument that remarkable experiences should not be ignored to maximize finances.

Not only will most of our incomes grow as we age (increasing the amount we could save later), but also our ability to enjoy cheap experiences decreases. A backpacking trip in Europe eating ramen noodles and sleeping in hostels sounds amazing when you're 20, but probably a little less so when you're 40. 

Another way to say this is that our enjoyment per dollar usually decreases as we age. To quote Ali Abdaal's review of this book, "not doing something relatively cheap when you're 18 years old to save money is like taking $10 from your kid's pocket money to pay rent. It makes no difference to the adult, but it'll make the kid miserable."

Lastly, memories are part of your retirement portfolio in the sense that, in large part, we retire on our memories. In old age, looking back on a life rich with extraordinary experiences will surely lead to a more relaxed and satisfying retirement, rather than feeling like you have cram in all the cool things you can still do while you still can.

### 2. Time Bucketing
If you're convinced experiences are worth the money and effort to invest in, how do we know what we want to do and when? Perkins introduces the idea of "time bucketing", and I think it's a good one.

Make a list of experiences you'd like to have in your 30's, in your 40's, in your 50's etc. You want to go on ski trips all over the western US? Would that be best done in your 40s or 60s? You want a big blowout relaxing vacation with your parents and kids? When is the best age of both parents and kids to enjoy that? Or for a counter example, you want to see all the national parks or go on a Hawaiian cruise? Those might be fine in your 60s or 70s.

Another approach for the same thing is to just write out a list of all the life experiences you can think of that you definitely want to have someday. Then categorize them into decades or 5 year periods where they are best used. Then when it's time to spend a little bit more than you're comfortable with (but that you can afford of course), you can do so at peace, knowing now is the time. 

When making these decisions, money, time, and health are all important factors to consider. While thinking about seasons of life like this, Perkins gives a framework for thinking about these three variables. In general, your different seasons of life only give you two of these three at a time. 

When you're young, you typically are rich in time and health, but have less money. It can make sense to work hard, take risks, and enjoy cheap experiences. 

In middle age, you typical have a decent income and good health, but little time. It might make sense here to buy back some of your time so that you can enjoy life more and have time for rich experiences. 

In old age you typically have a lot of time, hopefully have a good amount of money, and at some point will have less health than ever before. This just emphasizes the fact that it makes sense to prioritize your health in ALL phases of life, so that your older age can contain as many cool experiences as possible. It also reminds us not to delay all our best experiences until then. 

## Common Objections

### 1. Running out of Money Early
![burn_cash](/testpreviewsite/assets/burning cash.jpg)

This idea of "dying with zero" typically makes people uncomfortable at first. While the title is a bit extreme and certainly catchy, Perkins isn't totally deluded. He knows that literally dying with zero money is impossible, but thinks it's a worthy goal to pursue with a bit of cushion. So how do we manage to keep from running out of money before we die?

The first is just to have enough money that you are comfortable with your risk profile. In my article on Financial Independence, I discuss the 4% rule, which is one common rule of thumb to know how much money is enough. But whatever your risk tolerance and preference, it's important to know your number. 

Use an actuarial calculator to estimate how long you will live, add ten years if you want to be conservative. Look up historical investment portfolio data on something like firecalc.com and choose assumptions you are comfortable with for investment returns and drawdown time period. Just don't refuse to calculate anything and go in blind. We want to avoid using money as an excuse to defer life if you already have enough.

Additionally, Perkins recommends looking into longevity annuities. I'm not super familiar with these financial products, so won't offer advice on them. However my initial, non-expert takeaways are that if I can meet the financial goals I have well before traditional retirement age, then I shouldn't need them with my personal risk appetite. If things don't go as planned, and I have fewer investments when I'm 60 than I hope, I will look into these products.
 
### 2. Inheritance and Charity
Now for the most vehement objection. As Perkins puts it, "but what about the kids?!" I always found this topic interesting to think about even before having read this book. 

What is the optimal amount of money to leave your kids? I think most of us answer with the knee-jerk reaction "as much as possible" or "whatever's left". But to me it seems clear that more is not always better. If you'll indulge me in thinking about some extreme cases, we don't need to look further than most of the well-known families with "generational wealth" to see several poorly adjusted and unhappy children.

I've always admired Warren Buffet's answer to this question. He says he wants to give his heirs, "enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing." When I think about my own life so far, I don't think it would've been good for me at all to inherit so much money that I didn't have to strive for what I want. 

Now before we finish discussing how much to leave to children, let's think about the primary question Perkins asks in response to this issue. When is the best time to leave your children an inheritance? On average, an inheritance is given to heirs when they around the age of 60. I don't know about you, but I sure hope by the time I'm sixty, that I don't need an inheritance at all. 

I would probably conclude that 60 is later in life than is optimal for my children, and pretty much agree with Perkins' opinion that somewhere in the range of 25-35 years of age would be the best time to receive a monetary gift. Hopefully my kids have developed some skills with money and figured out some potential directions they'd like their life to go by then, and they still have time to do Buffet's "anything". 

Finally, Perkins discusses how your primary legacy to your children will not be monetary, but will rather be time spent with them and experiences together. If you agree and think about things through that lens, then working and saving longer than you have to actually decreases their inheritance.

These considerations really changed how I think about leaving money to my children. Here is my conclusion. I hope I'm wealthy enough to give them about 2-4 years of median American living expenses when they're 30ish. To me that seems like about the right quantity and timing to maximize cool opportunities without leaving them in a position where they don't have to earn money at all. And I hope it goes without saying that these considerations would also depend on my children themselves and their attitudes and abilities with money.

Now just a quick word on charity. Perkins claims we should give the money we want to give to charity as soon as possible. They need to money now and can make an impact with it now. If it was better to invest that money and let it grow before using it, presumably that's what the charity would do. 

Regardless, the main point is to be intentional with both the quantity and timing of your monetary gifts to heirs, charities, and anyone else. Perkins calls the conventional method by which many of leave our money (waiting till death and giving away what's left over) "the three R's". Leaving a random amount of money at a random time to random people. We might be able to avoid the last one with an airtight will, but it's no guarantee that all heirs will still be around at that point. 

Taking control of the amount and timing or your giving means you can treat that money like it's not your own, and prioritize maximizing life experiences the rest.

## Things I Disagree With
Although this is one of my favorite nonfiction books of all time and greatly influenced a lot of my thinking about lifestyle design, I definitely disagree with a few things. Or at least I think there's more nuance to the ideas.

First off, optimizing fun per dollar and creating cheap, fun experiences is a skill, and you have to practice it to be good at it. This is not in direct conflict with the tenets of Die With Zero, but if you're thinking of how to spend $5,000 dollars in the way to best maximize life experiences, you probably aren't considering cheap potluck house parties, crafts at the library, or camping trips. But these fun low cost activities can add loads of value to your experience portfolio.

Secondly, having extra money can give you options and resilience. Again, there's a point where too much is too much and you should know your number as discussed above. However, prioritizing savings early in life can give a cushion of money that allows you to weather challenging times or to take intriguing opportunities that have more risk or pay less. 

And lastly, the book seems to assume everyone will work a conventional career until retirement age and considers how to optimize spending and saving over the course of that cycle. As a fan of the concepts of FI and CoastFI, I know that doesn't have to be true. Usually through frugality, you can consider many lifestyle design choices that don't have to involve working full time for 40 years. 

This point is also not in direct conflict with the ideas in Die With Zero, but often our preferences or goals can change. Because of this, I do not recommend pacing your spending on remarkable experiences in such a way that it's maximized over the course of a 40 year career, because you won't know if that's what you want to do for the next few decades. There's definitely value in leaving yourself options to change your mind and have new experiences.

## Conclusion
I want to close with musing about how this book can be useful. In my mind it presents concepts that are great for anyone to think about with regard to lifestyle design. However, I think it truly becomes useful once you have a significant gap between your earnings and spending, whether that's through frugality or trough higher income. 

To me an example of a great way to progress ones' lifestyle design options is something like first getting to a 30%-50% savings rate (more of course is always nice) through frugality, high income, or both, but doing this without making life miserable in the process. Hopefully dodging some of the typical "depreciating assets" of expensive material goods. Then taking that excess, looking at your life, and deciding whether to devote a smallish percentage of it toward maximizing experiences, never forgetting to enjoy your life, while still stashing away savings for optionality down the road. 

We could maybe think of this as a well-diversified "portfolio", consisting of some excess savings for optionality as well as rich experience investments. This book provides excellent guidance on how to approach those experience investments.
