![Lucas](/assets/low quality.png)

My name is Lucas Beattie and I'm a structural engineer and software developer, primarily focused on bridges, in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati area. I'm working for [Eriksson Software](https://www.erikssonsoftware.com/), developing desktop applications for structural engineers. I really enjoy it when a slightly deeper dive into mechanics or math is needed to solve a problem, and have also used a whole lot of Excel VBA in my spare time and when I was working as a bridge design engineer. [See my resume][resume] for further information.

Some of my interests outside of work include reading, fitness, learning spanish, personal finance, and travel. I've also had had some more eclectic past forays into juggling, guitar, and table tennis.

I expect content on this site to be at least half engineering, excel, or programming related, and otherwise plan to write about my other interests, experiments, or activities. But I make no promises!
