![Lucas](/assets/low quality.png)

My name is Lucas Beattie and I'm a structural engineer, primarily focused on bridges, in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati area. Two of my primary interests in my role are structural analysis and programming, looking for ways to use SAP2000 and Excel VBA/macros in my work as often as possible. I also really enjoy it when a slightly deeper dive into mechanics or math is needed to solve a problem. [See my resume][resume] for further information.

Some of my interests outside of work include reading, fitness, personal finance, and travel. And I have had some more eclectic past forays into juggling, guitar, and table tennis.

I expect content on this site to be at least half engineering or excel related, and otherwise plan to write some about my other interests, experiments, or activities. But I make no promises!
